## Description

The goal of this project was to develop a timed trivia quiz covering content from Akira Toriyama's hit manga and anime series Dragon Ball. The goal is to answer the questions as quickly as possible as the score is based off of the time remaining upon asnwering the final question. If a question is answered wrong 10 seconds are reduced from the timer and thus the final score, which is saved to the browser alongside the user's intials for later viewing
